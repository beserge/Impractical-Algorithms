## Quantum Bogo-Sort
A quantum sorting algorithm which can sort any list in O(1), using the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics.  
  
1. Quantumly randomise the list, such that there is no way of knowing what order the list is in until it is observed. This will divide the universe into O(n!) unverses; however, the division has no cost, as it happends constantly anyway.  
2. If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe. (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)  
3. All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted.

## Anthropic Computing
There is at least one foolproof way to solve 3SAT in polynomial time:  
1. Given a formula ϕ, guess a random assignment x.
2. Kill yourself if x does not satisfy ϕ.  
Conditioned on looking at anything at all, you will be looking at a satisfying assignment!
